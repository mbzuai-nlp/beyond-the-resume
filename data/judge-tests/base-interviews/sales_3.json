That grounded me in relationship-building and negotiation. While finishing my degree, I transitioned into retail planning and now into a more end-to-end marketing and sales role with Luna & Co., where I manage everything from merchandise planning to product promotion and sourcing."

In my current role, I balance demand planning, supplier coordination, and promotional strategy with quality control, so nothing operates in isolation."

At the same time, I supported targeted promotions that helped move slower inventory without heavy discounting. It was a good example of aligning operations with marketing goals."
